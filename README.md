# Sprints_Projects
This repository collect multiple projects focused on embedded systems, real-time scheduling, and low-level software development, primarily using C, HTML, Assembly, and Makefile.

## **Main Components**

Automotive door control system design

Focus: Implements logic for managing automotive door functions.


Implementing-EDF-Scheduler

Focus: Demonstrates the design and implementation of an Earliest Deadline First (EDF) real-time scheduler.



Sprints_ARM

Focus: Contains projects or code targeting ARM microcontroller platforms.


## **Languages & Technologies**
C: Main programming language for embedded logic and firmware.

HTML: Possibly used for documentation or UIs in related projects.

Assembly: For low-level routines and hardware interfacing.

Makefile: Build automation for compiling projects.



## **Notes**

Ideal for those learning embedded C programming, automotive systems logic, and real-time scheduler design.
